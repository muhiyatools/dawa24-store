# ==============================================================================
# Dawa24 Store - production image (three binaries, one build)
# ==============================================================================
#
# Build speed notes (why this file is shaped the way it is):
#
#  - The builder image is pinned to a Go minor version. `golang:bookworm` is a
#    moving tag: when upstream ships a Go patch the digest changes, every cached
#    layer below it is invalidated and the whole tree recompiles from cold. A
#    pinned tag turns that from "every few days" into "when we choose to".
#
#  - `go mod download` is its own layer, keyed only on go.mod/go.sum, so it runs
#    again only when dependencies actually change.
#
#  - The build- and module-cache mounts survive between builds on a persistent
#    BuildKit daemon (which Elest.io's build host is). A warm cache turns a
#    full-tree recompile into an incremental one - only changed packages and
#    their dependents are rebuilt.
#
#  - .dockerignore keeps *_test.go, test/, data/, docs and *.md out of the
#    context, so a test-only or docs-only commit does not invalidate the
#    `COPY . .` layer and the build cache is reused as-is.
#
#  - The three binaries are built in one `go build` invocation so the dependency
#    graph is loaded and type-checked once, not three times.
#
#  - The runtime image copies only the binaries. Static assets and SQL
#    migrations are compiled into the binaries via //go:embed
#    (internal/ui/static, db/migrations), so there is nothing else to ship.
