-- 128_bulk_import_integrity (up)
--
-- Fixes surfaced by the bulk-import audit, applied as expand-only changes the
-- currently deployed image tolerates:
--
--   1. catalog.import_sessions gains the 'committing' status, the atomic claim a
--      commit takes before writing anything. Without it a crash between "the
--      catalogue was written" and "the session row said committed" left a ready
--      session that a second click would commit twice.
--   2. catalog.import_sessions gains new_categories, which prepare computed and
--      the review screen promised but nothing ever stored.
--   3. The master catalogue gets its own organisation. Resolution used to pick
--      the lowest-id approved organisation, so on this deployment the whole
--      imported catalogue lives inside a customer pharmacy's tenant. The
--      canonical organisation is created here and the import-created catalogue
--      is moved into it.
--   4. Variants get a real identity constraint: (organization_id, sku) among
--      live rows. Until now two concurrent imports — or two copies of one row
--      in a single file — could insert duplicates with nothing at the database
--      level stopping them.
--   5. ingest.import_batches / ingest.import_progress carried RESTRICTIVE-only
--      RLS policies. A restrictive policy can only narrow; with no permissive
--      policy alongside it, every role — including the table owner — is denied
--      every row forever. They get the standard permissive tenant policy.
