// Which suppliers can reach one point, as a set.
//
// ServesPoint answers the question one supplier at a time, which is the right
// shape for a purchase: there is one supplier and one branch and the answer
// gates one order. It is the wrong shape for a listing.
//
// A listing pages in SQL, so every predicate that decides whether a row belongs
// in the result has to be IN that SQL or the count is a lie. Coverage was the
// one predicate left in Go: the buying catalogue counted 1,695 offers for a
// Cairo branch and rendered two of them, because 1,553 of those offers came
// from a supplier that does not deliver to Cairo and were dropped after the
// page had already been cut. That is the same defect the offer-level pagination
// was built to remove, moved one layer down.
//
// Answering it as a set fixes that with one extra query per page: the covering
// suppliers are resolved once, and the listing filters on the resulting ids. It
// is the same predicate ServesPoint applies — the WHERE clause below is
// deliberately a copy of that one — so a row the listing shows cannot be a row
// checkout refuses for coverage.

// VendorsServing returns the organization ids that cover the given point on the
// given weekday.
//
// A supplier appears when it covers the target's city explicitly, or when the
// target's coordinates fall inside one of its delivery radii. Both arms are the
// ones ServesPoint uses; if that rule changes, this changes with it.
//
// The result is deliberately unbounded: a marketplace has tens of suppliers,
// not thousands, and a caller that filters on the set needs all of it.
