// SQL for the catalog.product_index read model.
//
// Two things were wrong here and are fixed in this file.
//
// First, `variant_id` was the literal NULL and `stock_quantity` was the literal
// 0, for every row. The columns existed, the reindex wrote constants into them,
// and nothing complained. On the live database that produced 28,786 indexed
// products of which **zero** had a variant and **zero** had stock, while
// inventory.stocks held 14,539 real rows. Any query of the documented form
// "active products with stock_quantity > 0" therefore returned nothing at all.
//
// Second, the index only ever held parent rows. A vendor's sellable offer is a
// *variant*, so an index without variant rows cannot answer "who sells this",
// which is the question the whole marketplace is built around. The
// `product_type` column was already there, and already said 'parent', so the
// intent was clearly to carry both.
//
// Stock is summed across warehouses for a variant. A variant stocked in three
// warehouses is one offer with the combined quantity; the per-warehouse split
// matters to fulfilment, not to whether a buyer can order it.

// stockJoin aggregates inventory per variant. Kept separate so the parent and
// variant queries cannot drift in how they count stock.

// parentSelect projects a catalogue product into an index row.

// A parent's stock is the sum of its variants' stock: the parent row answers
// "is this product obtainable at all", which is what catalogue search needs.
