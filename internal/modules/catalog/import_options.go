// than by the state machine itself.

// category, because nobody turns on a switch whose absence is invisible. The
// category IS the catalogue's organising column; leaving it empty is not the
// conservative choice, it is the broken one.
//
// What stays off is everything that invents a row rather than filling a column:
// AutoCreateCategories and AutoCreateBrands. Linking to a category that exists
