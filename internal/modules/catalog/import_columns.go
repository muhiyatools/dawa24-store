// Column identification for spreadsheet import.
//
// The previous mapper walked the header left to right and gave a column to the
// first field whose keyword it contained, first match winning. That is why a
// column headed i18n.TDefault("w4_mod.s_260_260") was bound to sku: the sku rule tested for
// i18n.TDefault("w4_ui.s_2_2"), which is a substring of i18n.TDefault("w4_ui.s_3_3"), and it ran before the barcode rule.
// The real barcode column was then unavailable and the real item-code column,
// further right, was never looked at.
//
// The fix is to stop deciding per column and start deciding globally. Every
// (field, column) pair is scored, and the assignment is made best-score-first
// with each column claimed once, so a strong signal anywhere in the header
// outranks a weak coincidence earlier in it.

// Import field names. These are the keys of the binding map that row parsing
// reads, kept as constants so a typo cannot silently produce an unmapped field.
