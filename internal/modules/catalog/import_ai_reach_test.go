// Whether the AI tier is reached at all.
//
// The tier only ever sees rows the deterministic engine left in a narrow band —
// plausible, but not settled — and with an empty catalogue there are no
// candidates to choose between, so there is nothing to ask about. Neither is a
// bug in the AI, and both are invisible without a test that says out loud when
// the tier is and is not reached.

// The switch is on, and the two that create rows are off.
//
// It was off for a while, on the argument that an unaudited import must be
// judged on the deterministic engine's own result. Sound in principle; what it
// produced in practice was a catalogue of nineteen thousand products with a
// null category, because a switch whose absence is invisible is a switch nobody
// turns on. The tier cannot invent a product — it only ever picks among
// candidates already retrieved, and every answer is re-checked against the
// catalogue before it is written — so the risk it carries is not the risk that
// justified the default.
//
// What must stay off is anything that mints a row rather than filling a column.
// Linking to a category that exists is reversible; creating one from a
// supplier's spelling is how a category tree becomes a drug index.
