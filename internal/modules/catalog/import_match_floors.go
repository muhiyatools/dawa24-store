// How confident the main-catalogue import has to be before it applies a match.
//
// Split out of import_match.go, which had grown past the 400-line limit
// AGENTS.md sets. Everything here is about the thresholds; import_match.go is
// about the passes that use them.

// MatchSimilar is a match made on name similarity with corroborating
// attributes rather than on an identifier. It updates an existing product, so
// the review screen marks it for a second look.
const MatchSimilar MatchReason = "similar"

// similarityFloor is the score at or above which a similarity match is offered
// as an update on the strength of the name alone.
//
// Higher than any other importer's, because the consequences differ: a vendor's
// wrong match mislabels one of their own offers, while a wrong match here
// overwrites the shared catalogue entry every pharmacy reads.
//
// What that produced, measured on the live table: 37,576 rows staged as
// `insert` with no reason, 82 as `similar`, 26 by name. A match rate of 0.29%,
// which means every re-upload of the same administrative file duplicates the
// catalogue. The floor was not wrong about the risk; it was the only tool being
// used to manage it.
const similarityFloor = 0.86

// corroboratedFloor is the score at or above which a match is offered as an
// update when something other than the name agrees as well.
//
// The engine's own settled levels — a barcode hit, a code hit, an exact folded
// name — are already identifiers rather than judgements. Below those, a strong
// score whose dose and pharmaceutical form both corroborate is a different
// proposition from a strong score on the name alone, and the identity re-check
// that guards the AI tier is available to say so.
//
// So the rule is: a bare name similarity still needs 0.86, and a corroborated
// one needs 0.78 — the figure the vendor import has always used, applied here
// only where the extra evidence exists.
const corroboratedFloor = 0.78

// matchFloors turns the administrator's one setting — أقل نسبة مطابقة — into the
// two floors this importer actually uses.
//
// Every import tool on the platform now offers the same control, defaulting to
// the same 50%, because a setting that means one thing in the vendor import and
// nothing at all in the admin import is worse than no setting. What differs is
// what the number buys: here it is the floor for a match the catalogue's own
// record corroborates — same dose, same pharmaceutical form, no identity
// conflict — and a match with nothing but the name agreeing still has to clear
// the far higher bare-name floor. Lowering the setting widens what a
// corroborated match may be; it never lets an uncorroborated one through.
//
// The bare-name floor is never allowed below its constant, whatever the
// administrator types. That is the one number protecting the row every pharmacy
// on the platform reads.

// vendor importer and the smart order had each grown their own copy of the same
// numbers, every one of them documented as measured, and no two of them
// agreeing. Reading the shared table means a change to what a run may spend is
// one edit rather than three, and the master-catalogue profile is deliberately
// the most conservative of the three because a wrong match here overwrites the
// entry every pharmacy reads.
//
// It also lifts the ceiling this import was working under. 24 by 25 was 600
// rows: on a thirty-thousand-row file that is two per cent of the residue, and
