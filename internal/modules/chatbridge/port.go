// Package chatbridge is what every chat channel bridge shares: Telegram and
// WhatsApp are transports over it.
//
// It holds the decisions that must not differ between channels — how a chat's
// user is rebuilt from the live RBAC resolver, which gates a question and a
// confirmation pass, and who is still owed a notification at delivery time —
// together with the port through which a bridge reaches the Capsule assistant.
// A channel package owns only its wire format, its link table and its
// delivery-error vocabulary.
