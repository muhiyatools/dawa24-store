// Running the staging pass without holding the vendor's browser open.
//
// Staging parses the whole file, scores every row against a catalogue of up to
// a hundred and fifty thousand products, and then asks a model about whatever
// the arithmetic could not settle. On a thirty-thousand-row price list that is
// minutes of work, and every second of it used to happen inside the POST that
// submitted the settings form.
//
// Three things followed from that, and all three were reported as bugs:
//
//   - The browser waited on a blank page and eventually gave up. Any proxy in
//     front of the application has its own timeout, and it is measured in
//     tens of seconds, not minutes.
//   - A vendor who navigated away lost the run. The context belonged to the
//     request, so cancelling the request cancelled the matching — halfway
//     through, with rows already staged and no way to tell which.
//   - Retrying looked like the fix and made it worse: a second POST started a
//     second full pass, including a second full AI bill, over the same file.
//
// The phase machinery to do better already existed and was only used by the
// commit path: PhaseProcessing has a screen of its own that polls, and
// ingest.import_progress persists how far a run has reached. Staging now uses
// both, so the vendor may close the tab, come back tomorrow, and find either
// the review screen or a progress bar that has kept moving without them.

// stageTimeout bounds one detached staging pass.
//
// Generous because the work is genuinely long — a large file against a large
// catalogue, plus the AI stage — and because the alternative to finishing is a
// vendor doing the matching by hand. A file that cannot be staged inside this
// is one whose column mapping is wrong, and the vendor is told so rather than
// left watching a bar that has stopped.

//
// The returned session is already in PhaseProcessing, so the caller can redirect
// straight to the screen that polls. An error means the run could not be
// started at all; once it has started, its outcome is reported through the
// session's phase rather than to the caller, who is by then a request that has
// long since been answered.
