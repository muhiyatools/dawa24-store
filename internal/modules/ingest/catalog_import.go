// against it and prices what it finds; what it cannot match is reported back to
// the vendor, with the candidates the engine considered, so they can correct
// their file or ask for the product to be added. Nothing is invented.

// Settings are the rules the vendor sets before processing starts.

// Every default is the conservative reading. An importer whose defaults widen
// the blast radius — treating a blank cell as zero stock, accepting a weak
// match, overwriting balances a price list said nothing about — is one whose
// first run has to be undone by hand.
