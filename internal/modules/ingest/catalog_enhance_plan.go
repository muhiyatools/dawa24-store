// Turning a run's rows into questions.
//
// The packing itself — the shared catalogue window, the byte budget, the
// collapsing of identical questions, the order the budget is spent in — lives
// in internal/shared/matchflow, because the smart order, the saving list and
// the master-catalogue import all did it too and the four copies had drifted.
// Only one of them enforced the byte budget; only one collapsed duplicates;
// none of them ordered the work, which did not matter while the stage saw only
// a residue and matters a great deal now that it sees whole files.
//
// This file is the translation between a vendor import's vocabulary and that
// one.
//
// Supplier files are where the shared window pays most. A distributor's price
// list is nine thousand rows of a few hundred molecules: the rows retrieve
// heavily overlapping catalogue products, so the twentieth antihypertensive
// costs its item line and nothing else.
