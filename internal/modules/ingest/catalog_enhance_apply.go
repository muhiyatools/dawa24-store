// Applying an answer, and refusing one.
//
// This is the file that decides what the model is allowed to change. Its bias
// is stated once and applies throughout: a wrong confident match ties a
// vendor's price and stock to the wrong medicine — a pharmacy then orders it
// believing the catalogue — while a refused match merely leaves a row on the
// review screen for a person to look at. So every guard here fails toward the
// deterministic outcome.
//
// The guards themselves live in matchflow.Verdict, because all four importers
// need the same ones and the four copies had drifted. What lives here is what
// each verdict MEANS to a vendor's catalogue:
//
//   - keep: the deterministic result stands.
//   - apply: the model resolved a row the engine could not.
//   - review: the model would not confirm a match the engine had already
//     applied. The row keeps its product and leaves the settled bucket, so the
//     vendor is asked. This is the outcome the verification pass exists to
//     produce, and it is the only one that can take a row OFF the automatic
//     path.
//
// Nothing here writes to the database. The stage hands back accepted matches
// and the caller applies them to the staged rows in one statement, which is
// what keeps a twenty-five-thousand-row import to a fixed number of round trips.
