// The AI enhancement stage of the vendor catalogue import.
//
// It is the same stage the smart order pipeline runs, asking the same question
// through the same prompt, and that is deliberate rather than convenient. Both
// features have one job here — "which product in this window is the medicine
// this line names, or none of them?" — and a second prompt would drift from the
// first the day either was tuned. Sharing it also shares the decision cache:
// an answer paid for by a pharmacy's order is free to the vendor whose file
// asks the same question, and the reverse.
//
// What it replaces, and why the old shape was expensive:
//
//   - It sent twenty-five rows per request with every row's candidates repeated
//     inside it. Supplier files are long and repetitive — the same twenty
//     antihypertensives are retrieved for every antihypertensive row — so that
//     repetition was most of the payload. Candidates are now de-duplicated into
//     ONE catalogue window that every item in the request references by id.
//   - It ran inside the row-streaming callback, once per five hundred rows, so
//     nothing could be shared or de-duplicated across the file. It now runs once
//     over the whole residue, which is what makes the window and the collapsing
//     of duplicate rows actually pay.
//   - It never consulted a cache. Vendors re-upload the same price list weekly
//     with a dozen rows changed; every re-upload was paid for in full.
//   - It skipped any row the scorer found nothing for — on live files most of
//     the residue, and exactly the rows that need a second opinion most.
//     Retrieval is now a separate, recall-tuned pass.
//   - It applied any answer above 0.70 that named an offered id. A wrong
//     confident match ties a vendor's price to the wrong medicine, so an answer
//     is now re-checked against the catalogue's own record before it is applied.
