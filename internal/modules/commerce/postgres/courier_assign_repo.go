// Handing a parcel to a delivery representative, and taking it back.

// AssignShipmentCourier puts one parcel on a courier's round, or returns it to
// the unassigned pool when courierUserID is nil.
//
// The supplier's id is part of the predicate rather than checked beforehand,
// so a shipment belonging to another company cannot be reassigned even if its
// id is guessed: the UPDATE simply matches no row and the caller is told the
// parcel was not found.
//
// The assignment timestamp is set by the database, not by the caller, because
// it is what the courier's queue is ordered by. A clock supplied by a request
// would let a parcel jump the queue.
//
// Reassigning an already-assigned parcel is allowed and re-stamps the date:
// the new courier has been holding it since they were handed it, not since it
// left the warehouse. Unassigning clears the date, so a parcel that comes back
// to the pool does not carry a stale age into someone else's round.
