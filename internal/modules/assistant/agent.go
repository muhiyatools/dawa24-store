// Which assistant a caller gets, and why it is not a setting.
//
// There are three agents because there are three dashboards, and a supplier
// asking "how are my sales" means something entirely different from a pharmacy
// asking the same words. Each agent has its own instructions, its own
// vocabulary and its own tools.
//
// Selection is a pure function of the authenticated actor. No request field
// names an agent, and there is no way to ask for a different one: the
// assistant is chosen by the same DashboardScope() call that decides which
// sidebar the user sees, so the agent and the screens can never disagree about
// who somebody is.
//
// This is a routing decision, not a security boundary. Even a caller who
// somehow reached the wrong agent would gain nothing: every tool re-checks the
// live actor's scope and permissions before it touches a query.

// AgentConfig is one assistant persona.
type AgentConfig struct {
	// Role is the dashboard scope this agent serves, stored on the
	// conversation so a user whose role changed cannot resume an old thread.
	Role rbac.Scope
	// Gate is the permission that must be held to use the assistant at all.
	// A pharmacy owner grants it per employee role; without it there is no
	// assistant, whatever else the employee can open.
	Gate string
	// SystemPrompt is the persona and the rules.
	SystemPrompt string
	// Label is what the drawer shows as the assistant's remit.
	Label string

// Gate permission keys. They are declared in the RBAC catalogue
// (internal/platform/rbac/catalog_*.go) and therefore appear in the role editor
// of the dashboard they belong to.
