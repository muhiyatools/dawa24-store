// Deciding which records an answer actually refers to.

// A turn may read twenty-five orders to compute one total and then mention
// none of them. Attaching all twenty-five to the answer would put a wall of
// chips under a single number and would linkify text that never named a record.
//
// So the rule is: a record survives if the answer mentions it, and if nothing
// was mentioned the list is empty. That keeps the reference strip honest — every
// chip under an answer corresponds to something the answer actually said — and
// it makes the inline linking cheap, because the client is handed only labels
// that are known to be present.

// linkEntities resolves collected records for the caller's dashboard and keeps
// the ones the answer names.

//     database never stores;
//   - runs of whitespace, tatweel, and case.

// Folding them away is the difference between "طلب رقم PO-1042" linking and
// not. It is used identically in the browser (capsuleFold), so the server's
// decision that a record is mentioned and the client's decision where to put
