// Turning an answer into something you can click.
//
// The assistant answers from rows it read out of the database, and every one of
// those rows is a record the user already has a screen for. Before this, an
// answer naming "طلب رقم PO-2025-0012" was a dead end: the reader had the
// number and had to go and find the order themselves.
//
// The mechanism here is deliberately general rather than a special case for
// orders. A read-model row declares itself referenceable by implementing
// Linkable; Collect walks whatever a tool returned and finds every such row,
// however deeply nested; ResolveLinks turns each one into a URL for the
// dashboard the caller is actually on. A tool added tomorrow whose rows
// implement Linkable becomes clickable by existing, with no change here, in the
// registry, or in the browser.
//
// Two rules keep it honest:
//
//   - An entity with no page on the caller's own dashboard produces no link.
//     A link that lands on a 404 or a permission refusal is worse than plain
//     text, so kinds with no destination are dropped rather than pointed at
//     something approximate.
//   - The URL is built HERE, from the row id the server itself read, never from
//     anything the model wrote. The model never sees an id and cannot influence
//     a href.

// EntityKind names a class of record that has a dashboard page.
