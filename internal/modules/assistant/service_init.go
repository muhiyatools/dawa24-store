// The agent loop.
//
// It is deliberately small. The model asks for data, the registry decides
// whether it may have it, the answer comes back, and the loop repeats until the
// model stops asking or the round budget runs out. There is no planner, no
// scratchpad, no self-critique step: every one of those costs a full round trip
// and none of them makes an answer about last month's spend more correct than
// reading last month's spend.
//
// What the loop does own is the two bounds that keep it from becoming
// expensive: a hard cap on rounds, and a hard cap on wall time. Both exist
// because an agent that cannot answer usually cannot answer with more tries
// either — it is asking the wrong question, and the useful response is to say
// so rather than to keep spending.

// maxToolRounds is how many times the model may call tools before it must
// answer. Six rounds covers complex multi-entity analytical reasoning
// ("list, detail, inspect relations, compare prices/stock, synthesize, answer").

// maxToolCalls caps fan-out inside a round as well as repeated rounds. A model
// may ask for several independent rows at once, so a round limit alone is not
// enough to bound database work or prompt growth.

// delta is lost — a proxy that buffered them, a model that answered in one
// piece after its deltas were dropped, a turn that produced no deltas at all
// because it spent its budget reasoning — the terminal frame still carries the
