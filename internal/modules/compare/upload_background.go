// Staging a supplier list without holding the pharmacy's browser open.
//
// UploadAndProcessCompareFile does two very different jobs in one call: it
// creates the file row, which is a single insert, and then it parses the whole
// workbook and writes every row of it, which on a thirty-thousand-row price
// list is seconds — times ten files in a batch, six at a time.
//
// All of that used to happen inside the POST. Three consequences, and the first
// two are the ones people reported:
//
//   - The browser waited on a blank page for minutes. /compare/upload is
//     exempt from the request deadline precisely so it could, which only moved
//     the failure to the proxy in front of the application.
//   - A pharmacy that navigated away lost the batch. The context belonged to
//     the request, so closing the tab cancelled the parsing — halfway through,
//     with some files staged and some not.
//   - Retrying looked like the fix and made it worse: a second POST re-uploaded
//     and re-parsed everything, against a quota that had already counted the
//     first attempt.
//
// The split here is the same one internal/modules/ingest made for the vendor
// import: register the file synchronously so the caller gets an id it can
// redirect to, then parse in a goroutine that outlives the request.

// stageTimeout bounds one detached staging pass.
//
// Generous because the work is genuinely long — the largest supplier lists on
// this platform are tens of thousands of rows — and short enough that a file
// which cannot be read at all does not hold a goroutine for ever.
