// The market, loaded whole, and grouped by product rather than by spelling.
//
// Both analytics screens used to build their own view of the market by calling
// ListMarketDiscounts with Limit: 50000. That method is the paginated feed
// behind /market-discounts and it clamps its limit to 100. So "the market" was
// the hundred most recently uploaded rows on the platform: تقرير ذكاء السوق
// reported an average discount over a hundred rows and called it the market,
// and مقارنة مع موردي السوق matched a supplier's fourteen hundred products
// against a hundred offers and reported the other thirteen hundred as حصري.
// That is the whole of why both screens looked broken, and no amount of UI
// work would have fixed either.
//
// The second half of the problem is what counts as "the same product". The old
// code grouped by three text keys derived from the raw name — a normalised
// form, a "core drug" key and a sorted-words key — and consulted them in turn.
// Text keys cannot see that فيتامين سي 1000 and Vitamin C 1000mg are one
// product, and they cannot see that two rows sharing a category word are not.
// The platform already has an engine that answers exactly this question, and
// its answer is stored: compare.file_rows.matched_product_id.
//
// So a group is a catalogue product where the row is matched, and the
// normalised name where it is not. Matched rows are the trustworthy half and
// they are kept separable, so every screen can say how much of its answer rests
// on the catalogue and how much on spelling.
