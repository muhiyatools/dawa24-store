package pipeline

// Turning a run's rows into questions.
//
// The packing itself — the shared catalogue window, the byte budget, the
// de-duplication of identical questions, the order the budget is spent in —
// lives in internal/shared/matchflow, because the smart order, the vendor
// import, the saving list and the master-catalogue import all did it and the
// four copies had drifted. This file is only the translation between a smart
// order's vocabulary and that one.
//
// What it adds is the second population. The stage used to see only the rows
// the deterministic engine could not settle, so the engine's CONFIDENT mistakes
// were the one class of error in the file that nothing ever looked at twice.
// Now every row whose match rests on a NAME goes to the model — the ones it
// could not settle, to be resolved, and the ones it did settle, to be checked.
//
// Rows settled on an identifier do not go. A barcode is the same physical
// package and the buyer's own confirmed mapping is their own assertion about
// their own vocabulary; a model cannot improve on either, and asking costs the
// budget that the ambiguous rows need.
