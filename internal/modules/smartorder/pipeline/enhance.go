package pipeline

// The AI enhancement stage.
//
// It runs after the deterministic engine has finished and seen the whole file,
// and it exists to answer the lines that engine could not: the ones it left
// unmatched (غير مطابق) and the ones it matched only tentatively, below the
// cutoff (مطلوب للمراجعة). Nothing it produces overwrites a confident
// deterministic result, and everything it produces is re-checked before it is
// written.
//
// Why the previous shape did not help, and what changed:
//
//   - It offered the model the five candidates the scorer had picked — the same
//     scorer that had just failed on that row. If the correct product was not in
//     those five, no amount of intelligence could find it, and when the scorer
//     found nothing at all the line was skipped entirely. On live data that was
//     most of the residue. Retrieval is now a separate, recall-tuned pass
//     (productmatch.Recall) that unions token, trigram and molecule strategies,
//     and lines with no shortlist are exactly the ones that need it most.
//   - It sent twenty-five rows per request with the candidates repeated inside
//     each one, so a run of five hundred residual lines was twenty requests, and
//     a ninety-second wall clock cut that off at seven. Candidates are now
//     de-duplicated into ONE catalogue window shared by every item in the
//     request, which is what makes a whole file fit in a single call.
//   - It scored a decision only against that row's own shortlist. The model may
//     now answer with any product in the window, which repairs the commonest
//     retrieval failure of all: the right product was retrieved — for the line
//     above.
