// LoadOffers returns every vendor variant of the given products, in ONE query.
//
// Two decisions are load-bearing here.
//
// **Where the data comes from.** Stock is read from inventory.stocks and the
// offer from catalog.product_variants — never from catalog.product_index's
// stock_quantity column. That column was the literal 0 for all 28,786 rows in
// production, so a query filtering on it returned nothing, for every product,
// silently. The read model is excellent at *finding* a product by name; it is
// not the authority on whether anyone has it.
//
// **Why it is one query for the whole file.** FR-017a forbids per-row work. A
// ten-thousand-line import resolves to at most ten thousand product ids, which
// go in as a single array and come back as one result set. Looping this per line
// is the difference between three minutes and an hour.
//
// Cross-tenant read: a marketplace buyer must see other organisations' products,
// which is the explicit invariant of a multi-vendor catalogue. It runs under
// database.AsSystem for that reason, and the buyer's own organisation is
// excluded in the WHERE clause rather than left to the caller.
