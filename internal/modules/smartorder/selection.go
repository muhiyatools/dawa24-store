// Supplier selection: strict priority within a tolerance band.
//
// The buyer orders the criteria they care about. The highest-priority one
// decides — but only among candidates that are not unreasonably more expensive
// than the cheapest eligible offer. That qualifier is the whole design.
//
// Strict priority alone is too rigid: "prefer suppliers I follow" would pick a
// followed supplier at any price, and a pharmacy that discovers it paid 40% over
// the market stops trusting the tool immediately. A weighted score is too opaque:
// the buyer asks "why this supplier?" and the honest answer is a number nobody
// can argue with. The band keeps the preference meaningful and bounded, and every
// line can still state in one sentence what decided it.
//
// All comparisons run on net price per unit *after* discount, in minor units.
// Comparing list prices would let a supplier win on a headline number while
// costing more, which is precisely the manipulation the buyer is trying to avoid.

// Select chooses one eligible candidate for a line under the given config.
//
// It is pure and deterministic: the same inputs produce the same selection, in
// any order, every time. Re-running an unchanged file must not quietly swap
// suppliers, or the buyer cannot tell a real change from noise.
