package aicapabilities

// Match enhancement.
//
// This capability answers one question and only one: for a pharmacy line the
// deterministic engine could not settle, which product in the catalogue window
// supplied with the request is the same medicine — or none of them?
//
// Everything about its shape follows from three facts.
//
// **The catalogue does not fit in a prompt.** Twenty thousand products at forty
// Arabic characters each is roughly a megabyte and several hundred thousand
// tokens, re-sent on every import of every pharmacy. So the request carries a
// *window*: the union of the candidates retrieved for the lines in it. Two
// hundred lines about antihypertensives retrieve heavily overlapping products,
// and de-duplicating that union is what turns a five-thousand-row catalogue
// block into a fifteen-hundred-row one.
//
// **The window is shared, not per item.** Each item names its own shortlist by
// id, but the model may answer with any id in the window. That costs nothing
// extra and repairs the most common retrieval failure there is: the right
// product was retrieved — for the line above.
//
// **The prompt is generated, never authored by a model.** RenderEnhanceInput is
// a pure function of the request. The same lines and the same window always
// produce byte-identical input, which is what makes the decision cache sound and
// what makes a prompt regression show up in a diff rather than in a bill.

// EnhancePromptVersion is the version of the question this capability asks.
//
// It is declared once, in internal/shared/matchflow, and re-exported here for
// call sites that already name it. It used to be declared here *and* in the
// smart order pipeline *and* in the vendor import, and the three had drifted:
// the vendor filed its answers under v3 while rendering the v4 prompt, so two
// features maintained two disjoint caches for one question.

// CatalogEntry is one catalogue product as the model sees it.
//
// Arabic name first, because that is what the pharmacy wrote and what the
// catalogue is authored in. The English name is carried too and earns its
// tokens: transliteration is where Arabic pharmacy matching actually fails, and
// "ابليفاى" against "ابيليفاي" is obvious the moment both rows show `abilify`.
