// Turning a saving list's rows into questions.
//
// saving_products_ai.go runs the stage and judges the answers. This file builds
// what is asked: one question per row worth asking about, each carrying its OWN
// retrieved window, which the shared planner then de-duplicates into one
// catalogue block per request.
//
// That last point is the defect this split was made during. The window used to
// be built once for the whole file and attached to every request, so a long
// list paid for its entire catalogue window on every call.
