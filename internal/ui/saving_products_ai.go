// The saving list's AI stage.
//
// It runs exactly the stage the other three importers run: the same prompt
// version, the same ceilings, the same shared decision cache, the same shared
// catalogue window, the same planner, the same identity re-check before an
// answer is written. Nothing here is a second implementation of the idea — the
// parts that could drift live in internal/shared/matchflow, and this file is
// the plumbing between them and a list of staged rows.
//
// Two things changed when the planner became shared, and both were defects
// only this importer had.
//
// It built ONE catalogue window for the whole file and then sent that entire
// window with every request. A short list never noticed. A long one paid for
// its whole catalogue window thirty times over, and past a few thousand rows
// the request stopped being answerable at all — the byte budget the other
// importers enforce was not enforced here, so nothing said so.
//
// And it asked only about rows the deterministic tiers left unlinked, which
// means a pharmacy's own list was checked everywhere except where the engine
// was confident. Every row whose link rests on a name now goes to the model:
// the unlinked ones to be resolved, the linked ones to be confirmed.

// enhanceSaving is the single entry point every staging path calls.
//
// The toggle is applied here rather than at each call site. There are four
// staging paths in this package, and the first version of this feature was
// wired into two of them — so it was present in the flow nobody uses and absent
// from the one the upload screen actually drives. One function that every path
// must go through is how that stops being possible.
