// The account lifecycle, asserted as a table.
//
// This is the question the rebuild started from: what can an account reach while
// its organization is still under review? The answer was "sixty-one routes,
// including wallet deposit and withdrawal", because the shared route group
// carried authentication and nothing else.
//
// TestPendingAccountApprovalLifecycle already covers `pending` and `approved`.
// It does not cover `under_review`, `rejected` or `suspended`, and those are
// the three that were actually reported. RequireApproved treats `under_review`
// exactly like `pending` and sends `rejected` and `suspended` to the same screen
// with a state — none of which was asserted anywhere until now.
//
// The table is the point. A reader answering "can a suspended vendor open the
// wallet?" should find the row rather than trace three middlewares.

// lifecycleActor builds an actor in a given organization state. Permissions are
// deliberately generous — every test here is about the *state* gate, and a thin
// permission set would let a test pass for the wrong reason.
