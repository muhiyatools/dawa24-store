// What an upload screen accepts, decided in one place.
//
// Five screens carried the same three-way extension test, and all five were
// narrower than the reader behind them: internal/shared/sheet decodes OOXML,
// legacy BIFF, the Office XML 2003 dialect, an HTML table and any delimited
// text file, and it decides which by SNIFFING THE BYTES rather than by
// trusting the name. A supplier who exports "prices.xlsm" from their ERP, or
// whose accounting package writes a tab dump named ".txt", was refused at the
// door by a screen that could have read the file perfectly.
//
// The extension check is kept, and this is what it is for: catching an obvious
// mistake before the file is read at all — someone picking a PDF, an image, a
// ZIP of invoices. It is a courtesy, not a format decision. Whether the bytes
// are a spreadsheet is the reader's answer to give, and its refusal names the
// real problem where a generic "unsupported format" never could.
