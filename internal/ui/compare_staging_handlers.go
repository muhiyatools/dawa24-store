// Telling the compare screen when a freshly uploaded batch is readable.
//
// The upload now returns as soon as the files are recorded, and their rows are
// read by a goroutine that outlives the request. That is what stops a ten-file
// batch from holding the browser open for minutes — and it means the screen
// receiving the redirect can no longer assume the columns have been detected.
//
// The column-mapping wizard in particular must not open on a file nobody has
// parsed: it would offer a mapping for a spreadsheet with no header row and no
// preview. It asks here first, and shows the shared progress dialog until every
// file in the batch has left `processing`.

// maxStagingBatch bounds how many ids one request may ask about.
//
// The upload quota is ten files on the largest plan, so anything past a couple
// of dozen is not a real batch — it is somebody probing the endpoint with a
// long list to make it do work on their behalf.
