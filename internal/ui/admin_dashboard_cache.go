// The admin dashboard's numbers, computed off the request path.
//
// This exists because of a production failure with a specific shape: signing in
// as an administrator left the browser loading until the hosting proxy gave up
// and answered 502, and while that was happening the rest of the platform
// crawled.
//
// The cause was not one slow query. Administrators land on /admin/dashboard,
// and that handler ran roughly fifteen service calls in sequence, each opening
// its own transaction — every one of which takes a connection from a pool of
// twenty and costs an extra round trip for the tenant GUC before it does any
// work. Several of those calls are unbounded aggregates over the largest tables
// on the platform: every visitor row, every product, every order, every saving
// product. Summed on one request, on a hosted database with real data, that
// exceeds any reasonable proxy timeout. And because the work is spent on
// connections and database CPU rather than on anything local, the cost lands on
// every other request too — which is why one administrator signing in was
// visible to everybody.
//
// Three properties fix it, and all three are needed:
//
//   - The numbers are CACHED. A statistics overview does not need to be
//     accurate to the second, so the database sees one computation per TTL no
//     matter how many administrators are looking or how often they refresh.
//   - The computation is SINGLE-FLIGHT and runs on a detached context. Two
//     administrators, or one administrator hammering reload, cannot stack
//     fifteen more transactions on top of the fifteen already running — which
//     is the mechanism that turned a slow page into a platform-wide stall.
//   - A request NEVER waits on it indefinitely. A stale snapshot is served
//     immediately while the refresh runs behind it, and the very first load
//     after a restart waits only a short budget before rendering with whatever
//     is ready. A dashboard showing slightly old numbers is a working
//     dashboard; a 502 is not.
//
// Money is kept here in minor units rather than formatted, because the strings
// the page displays are localised per request and a cached snapshot is shared
// across languages.

// dashboardSnapshot is one computed view of the platform's headline numbers.
