// window.ImportProgress does not exist yet.

// Every one of these call sites guarded itself with
//
//	if (typeof window.ImportProgress !== 'function') return;
//
// and that guard did exactly what it says: it returned. Silently, on every page
// load, with no error anywhere. The bar then kept whatever percentage the
// server had rendered into the HTML and never moved again — the vendor import
// sat at 1% while the run behind it finished, wrote 1,135 rows and moved to
// review, because nothing was ever polling to notice.
//
// The fix is a readiness fence: DOMContentLoaded fires only after every
// deferred script has run, and a document that is already parsed runs the
// initialiser immediately. This test requires one wherever the bars are started
// from an immediately-invoked block.
