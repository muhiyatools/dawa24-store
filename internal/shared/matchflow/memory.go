// The decision cache, as a port every import tool can hold.
//
// The cache itself is one table — catalog.match_decisions, keyed by
// DecisionKey — and it has always been shared in the sense that any tool
// writing to it fills it for the others. It was not shared in the sense that
// mattered: only two of the four import paths ever read or wrote it. The
// saving-list import paid for every question on every upload, and the
// administrator's master-catalogue import did too, while the vendor import and
// the smart order were answering the same questions for free.
//
// That is a port shape rather than an argument about caching. Each of the two
// tools that had one declared its own vocabulary for the same rows, so a third
// tool could only join in by inventing a third. This is the vocabulary, in the
// package that already holds the question, the ceilings and the key.

// Remembered is one answer as the cache stores it.
//
// A nil ProductID is "none of these", which is a real answer and worth
// remembering: it is what stops the next upload of the same price list paying
// to be told the same thing.

// makes an import slower and dearer; an import that refuses to run because the
// cache is down is worse than no cache at all.

	// 'ai_confirmed', which the deterministic alias tier deliberately excludes.

	// import trusts it.

// Recall resolves what is already known, and reports what is left to ask.
//
// It is offered here rather than written out in each tool because the shape is
// identical everywhere and the two existing copies had already drifted on the
// detail that matters: whether a remembered answer below the apply floor counts
// as answered. It does — the model was asked and declined, and asking it again
// costs money to be declined again.
//
// A nil Memory answers nothing and reports every key as pending, which is what
// makes the cache optional at every call site rather than at some of them.
