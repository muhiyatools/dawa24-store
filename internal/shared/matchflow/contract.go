// Package matchflow holds the contract every importer's AI matching stage
// shares: the question being asked, the shape of the request and the answer,
// and the ceilings one run may spend.
//
// It exists because three copies of that contract had already drifted. The
// prompt version is the decision cache's key, and the vendor import declared it
// "sm-enh-v3" while the smart order declared it "sm-enh-v4" — both rendering the
// same prompt through the same capability, and each filing its answers where the
// other would never look. On live data that was 2,913 cached decisions on one
// side and 3,584 on the other, for one question. The comment above the vendor's
// constant asserted the two matched.
//
// The ceilings had drifted too: 120 items per request against 200, thirty
// requests per run against twelve, six concurrent against four. Same gateway,
// same model, same question, two tables of numbers, each documented as measured.
//
// This package is a dependency-free leaf, so the modules that run the stage and
// the module that talks to the Gateway can all name the same types without
// importing one another — which the architecture forbids and which is what
// pushed each of them into declaring its own in the first place.
