// Reading a whole file into a grid.
//
// Streaming is the right shape for an import: a hundred-thousand-row workbook
// costs one row of memory. It is the wrong shape for a wizard that has to show
// the user a preview, let them re-map a column, and read the same file again —
// there the file is small, the code is a handler, and a grid is what it wants.
//
// So this is offered alongside Walk rather than instead of it. What it replaces
// is internal/shared/spreadsheet, a second reader that existed only to provide
// this one function and that had drifted: it sniffed formats the streaming
// reader did not and missed formats the streaming reader handled, so two
// features could disagree about whether the same upload was readable.

// maxGridRows bounds what a caller may pull into memory at once.
//
// Two hundred thousand rows of a dozen columns is roughly a hundred megabytes
// of Go strings — already past what a request handler should hold, and far past
// any file a person is going to review by hand in a wizard. A caller that
// genuinely needs more is doing an import, and an import streams.

// ReadRows decodes an entire file into a grid of cleaned cells.
//
// Every cell is passed through CleanCell, which strips the NUL and C0 padding
// that legacy BIFF writes inside its string records. PostgreSQL rejects those
// outright in a text column, so a single invisible byte used to fail a whole
// import batch with an error naming an encoding rather than a row.
//
// filename only improves error messages and delimiter hints; the format is
// decided by the bytes.
