// Narrowing the question a resolver is asked.
//
// The field catalogue is the union of everything any importer can read, and
// that union is wrong for every importer taken alone. A pharmacy uploading a
// shopping list has a name and a quantity; offering its two columns to
// twenty-nine fields invites the resolver to bind one of them to "cost price"
// on weak evidence, and the buyer then sees a mapping screen asking them to
// confirm a field their file does not contain. A saving-products file has four
// columns and the same problem.
//
// Before this existed, each importer answered it by writing its own resolver
// with its own shorter list — which is how the same header ended up meaning the
// item code in one system and the barcode in another. A field set says which
// questions to ask; it does not change how any of them are answered.

// FieldSet is the subset of the field catalogue one importer can use.
//
// A nil FieldSet allows everything, so a caller that has no opinion behaves
// exactly as before.
