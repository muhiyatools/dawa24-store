//
// This is the half of the identity check that has to be GENEROUS. A pharmacy
// types "ازرجا" for the catalogue's "ازارجا" and "ارمو ويك" for its "ارموويك",
// and a comparison that calls those strangers throws away the matches the AI
// stage exists to find.
//
// It is also the half that has to be STRICT about one particular shape: a shared
// prefix. "امبريد" and "امبريديل" look alike by every overlap measure and are
// different medicines, and Egyptian brand names collide at the front far more
// often than by chance. So the two acceptance paths are tuned against each
// other — edit distance carries the spelling variants, and trigram overlap sits
// high enough that a prefix collision cannot use it.

// Thresholds for the shared-word evidence check. See sharedProductWord.

	// would refuse the brand for being sold in three doses.
