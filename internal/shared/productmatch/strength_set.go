//	"a-viton 50.000 i.u. 20 caps"  ->  no strength at all
//
// "i.u." is not "iu" — the dots make it three tokens — and "50.000" is the
// European thousands separator every Egyptian pack of vitamin A and D is
// printed with, which parses as fifty. So the row stated nothing, and a
// 50,000 IU capsule was free to match a 100 mg one.
//
// The thousands rule is deliberately narrow: it applies only where the unit
// that follows is an international unit, because IU doses in this catalogue are
// large whole numbers and never fractional. Applied generally it would rewrite
// "0.075 %", which is a real concentration.

// Reading every dose a name states, including the ones written as a ratio.
//
// This file moved out of recall.go, and it moved because it was wrong in a way
// that cost the engine four of the twenty-five wrong matches it was measured
// making.
//
// strengthPattern captures "a figure, optionally a second figure after a
// separator, then a unit". So "10/20mg" arrives here as ONE match containing
// both figures — and parseStrength, whose job is to answer "what is this
// product's strength" with a single number, cuts the numeric part at the first
// "/" and keeps the head. The 20 was thrown away.
//
// ratioLeads could not recover it, because ratioLeads looks BEHIND the match
// and the 20 is inside it. So:
//
//	"alkor plus 10/20mg"   ->  [10 mg]
//	"الكور بلس 10/40 مجم"  ->  [10 mg]
//	"الكور بلس 20/10 مجم"  ->  [20 mg]
//
// which reads as: the row AGREES with the wrong product and CONTRADICTS the
// right one. Every combination family written "A/B unit" with B a whole number
// behaved this way — Alkor Plus, Amloveran, Amlosazide, Kerdipine Plus — and
// the engine applied a sibling at the wrong dose with "تطابق التركيز" printed
// beside it as the reason.
//
// The correction is to expand the whole ratio rather than its head. Order does
// not matter and must not: comparison is set-based, so 10/20 and 20/10 are the
// same product written by two people, while 10/40 is a different one. That is
// the property the fix exists to restore.

// maxRatioParts bounds how many components one dose may carry.
//
// Four. The widest real combination in this catalogue is three
// ("املوفيران بلس 10/2.5/5مجم"), and a fourth is allowed for the ones written
// with a vehicle. Past that the figures are a lot number or a date, and reading
// them as doses would invent contradictions.
const maxRatioParts = 4

// strengthSet is every dose a text states, not merely the first.
//
// parseStrength answers "what is this product strength", which is the right
// question for scoring and the wrong one for a veto. A catalogue entry written
// "اتاكاند بلس 32/25 ملجم" states two doses, and a pharmacy line that says 32
// agrees with it — but parseStrength reads only one figure, so a first-figure
// comparison would block the correct match as a conflict. Blocking correct
// matches is the failure this guard exists to prevent, not to cause.
//
// A ratio's figures reach this function from two places: the ones the pattern
// captured with the unit, and the ones written before it. Both are scaled by
// the unit that governs them, because only the figure carrying the unit was
// scaled by parseStrength. Ratios of *different* units ("250مجم/5مل") do not
// have this shape and are left alone, which is correct: those are
// concentrations, not combinations, and each half is already recorded under its
