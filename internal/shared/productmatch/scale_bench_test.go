// requirement nobody measures is a hope. This is the whole file end to end —
// build the index once, then match every row — reported as wall clock and as
// rows per second, so a change to retrieval or scoring that doubles the cost
// shows up as a number rather than as a support ticket.
//
// It is a Test rather than a Benchmark because what matters is the total for
// one import, not the per-operation average: an import that takes four seconds
// and an import that takes four minutes are different products, and `go test
// -bench` reports neither.
