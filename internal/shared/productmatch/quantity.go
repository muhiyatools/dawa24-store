// The figures and the letters that separate one product from its neighbours.
//
// A brand family is written as one name plus one distinguishing mark, and the
// mark is almost never a word. It is a figure — 20 tablets against 200, a 25 g
// tube against 50 — or it is a single letter: بتنوفيت ان and بتنوفيت سي are
// Betnovate N and Betnovate C, two different medicines, and the whole
// difference between them is one letter that coreTokens discards for being too
// short to be a word.
//
// Both were invisible to the scorer. Figures reached it as an unordered bag in
// which a pack count and a bottle size and half a combination dose were the
// same kind of thing, compared by asking whether the shorter bag was contained
// in the longer one — which is true of "16" inside "16 و 12.5", so اتاكاند 16
// and اتاكاند دي 16/12.5 agreed on their numbers and differed on nothing else
// the engine could see. Letters reached it not at all.
//
// This file reads a name once and says what each figure was counting.
