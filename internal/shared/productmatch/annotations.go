// The trade annotation an Egyptian distributor types after the product name.
//
// A price list is not a catalogue. The name column of a real distributor file
// carries the product AND the terms of sale, run together in one cell, because
// the person maintaining it reads the whole line at once:
//
//	بانتولوك 20 مج 14 قرص ج/باكت 10     the product, wholesale, ten to a carton
//	اتوريزا 10/20 مجم 21 قرص س 141 ج    the product, priced at 141 pounds
//	افيتركس جيل س ج2                     the product, price in pounds
//
// Everything after the form in each of those is bookkeeping. The catalogue says
// بانتولوك 20مجم 14 قرص and means the same medicine at the same price — and the
// engine refused all three, because the annotation is made of exactly the two
// things it reads as identity: single letters and figures.
//
// The س and the ج became identity marks — the letters that separate بتنوفيت ان
// from بتنوفيت سي — so a row agreeing with its catalogue entry on the brand, the
// strength and the form was ranked behind everything that did not carry them.
// The carton count became a stray figure the catalogue's pack count
// contradicted. Measured on nine live supplier files, that one reading was the
// largest single cause of an unmatched row: more than the retrieval misses, the
// form conflicts and the strength conflicts put together.
//
// So the tail is cut before anything reads the name. Cutting rather than
// filtering, and only a TAIL, because that is the shape the convention actually
// has: the annotation is appended after the product is fully described, never
// interleaved with it. That shape is what makes the rule safe on the names it
// must not touch — دلتافيت ب 12 اقراص is a vitamin whose B12 sits BEFORE a form
// word, so no suffix of it is all annotation and nothing is cut, while
// ريكوكسبرايت 60 مج اقراص 3 شريط ب12 ends in a carton of twelve and loses it.
