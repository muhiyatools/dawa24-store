// Refusing a match the model was confident about.
//
// The failure this file exists to prevent is specific and was reported from
// live use: two products that share a couple of words being matched as one.
// Egyptian pharmacy catalogues are full of families that differ by a single
// word — بانادول / بانادول اكسترا / بانادول نايت / بانادول ادفانس, ديكلوفين /
// ديكلوفين بلس / ديكلوفين فاست — and a model reading "بانادول 24 قرص" against
// "بانادول اكسترا 24 قرص" sees five characters of difference and four words of
// agreement. It is a different medicine.
//
// The prompt says all of this. The prompt is not enough, and it never will be:
// an instruction is a tendency, and what a pharmacy receives should not rest on
// one. So every answer is re-checked here against the catalogue's own record
// before it is written.
//
// The guards can afford to be strict because of what failure means. This runs
// only on AI-proposed matches, and a refused match leaves the line exactly as
// the deterministic engine left it — reported honestly as unmatched or needing
// review. A false refusal costs one line of manual work. A false acceptance
// ships the wrong drug.

// MatchConflict is why a proposed match was refused. Its zero value means the
// match survived every check.
