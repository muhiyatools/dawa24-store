// The letters that separate one product from its neighbours.
//
// quantity.go reads the FIGURES out of a name. This file reads the LETTERS: the
// N of Betnovate N, the S of Blanka-S, the CR of a modified-release line — and,
// just as importantly, the F and C of "f.c.tabs", which are film-coating and
// name nothing.
//
// The distinction between those two is the whole content of this file, and it
// is worth its own page: reading an abbreviation as an identity raised a false
// conflict on one labelled row in five, and reading an identity as an
// abbreviation is how بتنوفيت ان came to be matched to بتنوفيت سي.

// clioquinol) against plain بتنوفيت; بلانكا اس against بلانكا; مازيمال سي ار,
// which is the modified-release line. Every one of those is a different
// medicine at a different price, and every one of them was invisible: coreTokens
// drops a word shorter than two runes outright, and rarity weighting reduces
// what is left to noise.
//
// Both alphabets fold onto one key, because the same product is written "N" by
// one supplier and "ان" by the next.
