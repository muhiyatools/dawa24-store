// Package rbac is the single source of truth for what may be controlled by a
// permission, and for how a held permission is matched against a required one.
//
// Before this package the answer lived in three places that could not agree:
// hardcoded strings in the sidebar templates, hardcoded strings in the route
// registrars, and rows in identity.permissions seeded by a migration. They did
// drift — the admin sidebar gated six items on keys such as
// "notifications.notification.view" and "workflow.coverage.view" that no row
// ever existed for, so those links were invisible to every account except
// super_admin, and no role could ever be granted them.
//
// The catalogue declared here is the definition. The database table is a
// mirror, synced from this package at boot (see Sync), so a permission cannot
// exist in a role editor without a Go declaration, and a route cannot be gated
// on a key nobody can be granted.
