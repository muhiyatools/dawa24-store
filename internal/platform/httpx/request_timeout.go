// RequestTimeout gives every request a deadline on its context.
//
// Without one, a handler blocked on a slow query or an exhausted connection
// pool waits indefinitely. Two things then happen, in this order: the server's
// WriteTimeout fires and closes the connection, and the reverse proxy in front
// of it — which saw a connection close before any response — reports 502 Bad
// Gateway. The user sees a gateway error for what was really one slow query.
//
// Worse, the abandoned handler keeps its pool connection. Under load the slow
// requests pile up, the pool empties, and every other request starts waiting
// too: one slow endpoint takes the whole site down with 502s that name no
// cause.
//
// A context deadline fixes the cause rather than the symptom. pgx honours it,
// so the query is cancelled server-side and the pool connection comes straight
// back; the handler returns an error the app renders as a normal page. The
// deadline is set shorter than the server's WriteTimeout on purpose, so the
// application always wins the race and gets to write a real response.
//
// Long-lived responses are exempt: a streamed download or an event stream is
// meant to stay open, and a deadline would truncate it.

// LongRequestBudget is how long a long-running request may hold its socket.
//
// It exists because exempting a route from the CONTEXT deadline did nothing
// about the two deadlines that actually cut these requests off, and those are
// on the connection rather than the context:
//
//   - http.Server.ReadTimeout (15s) bounds reading the WHOLE request, body
//     included. A pharmacy uploading a 30 MB price list over a 2 Mbps Egyptian
//     upstream needs two minutes to send it, and the server closed the socket
//     after fifteen seconds — every time, for everyone on a slow link. That is
//     the "uploads take forever and then fail" report: the transfer never
//     completed, so the browser either hung on a dead connection or retried the
//     whole file from the start.
//   - http.Server.WriteTimeout (30s) starts when the request headers are read,
//     so it bounds the handler as well as the response. A compare batch that
//     legitimately parses for a minute had its connection closed underneath it
//     at thirty seconds, and the proxy reported 502 with no cause — while the
//     handler carried on working and writing rows nobody would ever see.
//
// Fifteen minutes. Long enough for a large file on a poor connection plus the
// work that follows it, short enough that a wedged handler still lets go of its
// socket. Background processing shortens the second half of that considerably;
// this is the ceiling, not the expectation.
const LongRequestBudget = 15 * time.Minute

// UploadRequestBudget bounds an upload that is not otherwise long-running.
//
// It is a real deadline, and it has to be: without one a stalled upload holds
// its handler, and with it its pool connection, which is how one slow endpoint
// used to take the whole site down. Ten minutes is generous for a spreadsheet
// and short enough to be a ceiling rather than a licence.

// fifteen-second read deadline like any other form post. A form post is a
