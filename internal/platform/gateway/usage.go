// Writing down what every AI call cost, as it happens.
//
// The Gateway keeps its own request log, and for a while that was the only
// record: the usage cards and the AI logs screen called api.muhiya.com live on
// every page render and displayed whatever came back — capped at a hundred
// rows, with no history beyond the Gateway's retention, and blank when the
// Gateway was unreachable. Everything the screens could not get, the handlers
// invented.
//
// Nothing here changes what the Gateway bills. It records what it billed,
// locally, attributed to the منشأة that spent it and to the feature that asked.
// Every field was already on Response at the moment a call returned and was
// simply dropped on the floor.
//
// The recording is deliberately a decorator rather than a branch inside
// HTTPClient. A ledger that can fail must not be able to fail a completion, and
// keeping it outside the transport makes that structural instead of a rule
// somebody has to remember.
