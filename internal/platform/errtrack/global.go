// The three places that turn a failure into a response — httpx.Error,
// httpx.Recover and the UI's error page — are middleware and helpers with no
// dependency injection of their own, and threading a tracker into each would
// mean changing every call site of every one of them. A process-wide tracker,
// installed once at start-up, is the smaller change and matches how the asset
// resolver and the gateway settings are already wired here.

// It is an atomic pointer rather than a plain variable because Install runs
// during start-up while the readiness probe may already be serving.
