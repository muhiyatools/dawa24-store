// Editing a migration that has already run.
//
// The runner refuses it — an applied migration is immutable, and a database
// whose files no longer describe how it was built cannot be reproduced. But
// the refusal happens at deploy time, in a container whose only visible symptom
// is `service "migrate" didn't complete successfully: exit 1`, with the
// migrations themselves already applied and everything that runs after them
// (the permission catalogue sync, in particular) silently skipped.
//
// That is a slow, confusing way to learn something a query answers in a second,
// so migratecheck answers it first. It costs one round trip and runs before the
// dry-run, because there is no point rehearsing SQL that the runner will not
// reach.
//
// The fix is never to restore the hash by hand: put the change in a NEW
// migration and return the applied file to exactly what it was.

// driftReport is one migration whose file changed after it ran.
