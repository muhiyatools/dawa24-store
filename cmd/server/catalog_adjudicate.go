// The administrator's catalogue import asks the same question as everyone else.
//
// It used to ask it with its own system prompt, its own response schema and its
// own wire types, in internal/modules/catalog/gateway/adjudicate.go — a third
// phrasing of "which of these catalogue products is this row, or none of them?"
// alongside the smart order's and the vendor import's. Three prompts is three
// things to tune, three ways to drift, and three populations in a decision cache
// that is keyed by the prompt's version.
//
// This adapter translates the catalogue module's port onto the shared
// capability, so the module keeps its own vocabulary and the platform keeps one
// prompt. The translation is mechanical and lives here because this is the only
// place allowed to know about both.

// AdjudicateMatches answers a batch of ambiguous catalogue rows.
//
// The catalogue module hands each row its own shortlist. The shared capability
// takes one de-duplicated window that every row may answer from, which is
// strictly more information for the same tokens — and it repairs the retrieval
// failure the per-row shape cannot: the right product was retrieved, for the row
// above.
//
// What it may answer with is still bounded. import_match.go rejects any product
// that was not on *that row's* shortlist before applying it, so widening the
// window widens what the model can see without widening what it can do.
