// Building the router is not a formality. chi panics at mount time for a whole
// class of mistakes — a Use() after the first route on a mux, a duplicate
// pattern, a malformed path — and none of them are visible to the compiler, to
// go vet, or to a test that exercises a handler in isolation.
//
// RegisterPublicRoutes called r.Use(h.visitorMiddleware) on the root mux, which
// by then already carried the identity routes. Build, vet and the whole suite
// stayed green; the binary panicked on boot in production:
//
//	panic: chi: all middlewares must be defined before routes on a mux
//
// The dependencies are deliberately unconnected, because that is the state the
// real server mounts in — routes are registered before the database and cache
// finish connecting, which is why a nil-safe database.New() is the right
// stand-in and a nil *DB is not.
