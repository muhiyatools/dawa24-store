// promise the drawer makes to the user in words, so it is kept by a job rather
// than by anyone remembering: the deadline is a column with an index on it, the
// sweep is a DELETE against that index, and messages, turns and attachment rows
// go with it by cascade.

// on a six-month schedule; uploads that were never actually sent with a
// question are worthless after a day and cost object storage until they go.
