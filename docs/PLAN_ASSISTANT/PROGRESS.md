## 2026-09-02 — read-only business agent

See `03_READ_ONLY_AGENT.md`. The assistant now answers from the caller's own
authorized data through a permission-gated tool registry, and writes nothing.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-user conversation leak closed | done | `GetOwnedConversation` scopes by org, user and agent role in SQL |
| Owner-controlled permission | done | `pharmacy/vendor/platform.assistant.use` in the RBAC catalogue |
| Least privilege | done | every tool also requires the permission its dashboard screen requires |
| Three agents, one model | done | persona and tool set differ; `assistant.primary` throughout |
| Role routing | done | `assistant.AgentFor` on `DashboardScope()`; no client input |
| Signed, actor-bound handles | done | forgery, expiry, kind and binding all verified |
| Read-only data access layer | done | 17 read methods, no write path, RLS on every query |
| Tool registry + 10-step dispatch | done | audited in `assistant.tool_audit` |
| Server-owned resumable turns | done | Redis in production, memory in development |
| EventSource client | done | fixes the resize/minimise token loss |
| Attachments in object storage | done | rows + digests, no base64 in memory or Postgres |
| Tenant-keyed transcription, dynamic model | done | admin catalogue discovery, 15-minute cache |
| Markdown renderer with tables | done | escaped first, http(s) links only |
| Context/usage meter | done | real `context_window` from `/v1/models` |
| Six-month retention | done | indexed deadline, daily worker sweep, stated in the drawer |
| Security suite | done | 17 hostile-model cases plus handle, stream, agent and fence tests |
| Order creation / write tools | **dropped** | out of scope by decision; the agent is read-only |
